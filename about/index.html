<p>I grew up on a farm in Wales. As a child I watched my father
balance the short-term productivity of the land against its long-term
sustainability. I often thought about how we as a species interact
with out environment - how we shape it, and it shapes us.</p>

<p>A farmer is utterly beholden to the weather. I wanted to understand
what causes the vagaries of the atmosphere which so clearly impacted
our livelihood, and how they might change in the future as a result of
climate change. I was also decently good at mathematics and physics,
so I decided to go to the University of Reading to study
meteorology.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate degree, and after a brief summer stint on
placement at the Met Office, I decided I wanted to try a career in
scientific research. I started a PhD project, again at the University
of Reading, on the climate impacts of stratospheric aerosol
geoengineering. Initially I didn't want to touch the project because I
was too unsettled by the concept of intentionally modifying the
climate. However, my supervisors (Andrew Charlton-Perez and Ellie
Highwood) pointed out a healthy scepticism is valuable in science, and
I am glad they were so persuasive. The topic was a great frame through
which to think about fundamental climate problems and prompted some
fascinating investigations into science and policy problems.</p>

<p>After my PhD I moved to the University of Exeter to work as a
post-doc with Mat Collins and Hugo Lambert. My work focuses on climate
feedbacks and emergent constraints on climate sensitivity. I continue
to work on geoengineering as well. See my list
of <a href="../projects">projects</a> for more details about my
research.</p>
