Arriving at the Vienna International Centre is a very exciting
experience. I went to the conference centre yesterday to pick up a
programme and to get my bearings, together with some other PhD
students from Reading.

We wandered amongst the half-prepared stalls and peeked into the rooms
in which our presentations would be held. It was exciting to imagine
the place jam-packed with scientists and bursting with new research
ideas.

After a late lunch in the Innerstadt we headed back to the hotel to
relax before going back to the conference centre for the opening
reception. People flooded into the conference centre to meet old
friends and make new ones. I was in bed quite early though, given I
was presenting at 9:30 the following morning!

I presented my work at the Open Climate session. The audience was
bigger than I had expected, but I think it went OK. It's very easy to
think of all the things one should have said once the talk is done. It
wasn't a disaster though, which means it counts as a success. This was
my first time presenting at such a big conference and I am sure future
presentations will be much improved by the experience.

I got some good feedback and comments after the talk, which was much
appreciated. Now I can fully.enjoy the delectable menu of scientific
delights EGU 2013 has to offer.

It's going to be a great week. The Sun has even come out!
