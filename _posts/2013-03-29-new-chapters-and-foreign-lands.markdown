By January of this year a major chunk of my PhD work was winding to an
end. I had spent a long while looking at the effect of stratospheric
aerosol geoengineering on the circulation of the stratosphere, which
will form the second (and probably biggest) of the three results
chapters in my PhD thesis. At the start of my project I had spent a
lot of time reading about stratospheric dynamics and it's now a
somewhat familiar area to me. Well, almost. I still find some chunks
counter-intuitive, and sometimes downright baffling. But at least it's
baffling in a familiar way.

We are always reluctant to move away from the familiar. But the work
for my final results chapter required that I take the plunge into
material and theory that was very much unfamiliar. I was going to look
at the impacts of geoengineering on the tropospheric circulation. I
eased myself into it by thinking about the tropospheric jet streams
first. I at least have some grounding in this area. The dynamics of
the midlatitude jet streams is somewhat similar to the dynamics of the
stratosphere, and my undergraduate degree in Meteorology has quite a
heavy emphasis on the theoretical underpinning of it all. The work on
the jet was a nice transition.

Recently (over the past month or so) I have been thinking about
precipitation. Especially tropical precipitation. Now, the Earth's
Tropics are meteorologically very different from the midlatitudes. In
the midlatitudes the
[Coriolis Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect) is a
significant effect and weather is determined by large scale wavelike
motions producing depressions and anticyclones. Rainfall is mostly
frontal in nature. In the Tropics the Coriolis Force is negligible. As
a consequence we don't usually see very large horizontal temperature
gradients. This means we don't see large, rotating weather
systems. Rain comes from convective storms, on a much smaller scale
than midlatitude frontal depressions. There is so much moisture in the
air in the Tropics that the vertical temperature profile pretty much
everywhere shows evidence of the release of heat when water vapour
condenses to form rain. This forms a characteristic moist adiabatic
temperature profile (see image below). Without a strong Coriolis Force
this temperature profile is spread over the Tropical belt, so we see
it even outside the rain-producing regions.

In order to interpret my model results I had to learn to think
differently. Intuitions learned from midlatitude dynamics don't apply
this close to the Equator.

Learning new theory can be pretty intimidating. It's difficult to know
which paper to read first. Sometimes I find myself feeling
paralysed. I have a pile of things to read but keep having to refer to
different sources to understand terminology, or to get to the bottom
of some 'obvious' physical understanding not fully explained in one
piece of research. Then I took a different tack. I went to see one of
the hundreds of other people working in the Department of Meteorology.

This department has experts on any conceivable area, and now, when I'm
learning new theory, this is becoming invaluable. In a single hour
with a researcher in tropical meteorology I 'got' it. I understood the
fundamental differences between tropical and midlatitude thinking. Now
I can read those papers with confidence. Now I understand the
terminology, and a little of the intuition as well. Self-teaching
works well (and is entirely necessary for a PhD student) but spending
a little time with an expert can help one learn _how to teach
oneself_. This is much the same as, how, when learning a foreign
language, you must first learn enough to communicate on a basic
level. Once you have that, you can begin to immerse yourself, to learn
from conversation with native speakers. The amount of learning that
goes on increases exponentially with time. You learn far more from
native speakers. But you need to do that initial bit of work to access
this higher plane of learning.

Talking of foreign lands, I will soon be off to the 2013
[EGU](http://www.egu2013.eu/) (European Geosciences Union) General
Meeting in Vienna. It's a colossal conference (nearly 12,000 people
attended last year) and I'm sure the experience will be educational,
entertaining, confusing and exhausting. I'm sure I could list
adjectives forever on that one. I will try to write some blog posts
and Tweets during the conference, reflecting on what it's like for a
naive young PhD student to be launched into one of the world's biggest
academic conferences.
