I have just come out of the EGU session on geoethics and jotted down a
couple of thoughts in my notepad. One of the speakers told us about
placements their organisation
([Geology for Global Development](http://www.gfgd.org/)) coordinates
help scientists learn about social and ethical issues and how they
relate to their research.

He specifically mentioned teaching of participatory decision-making.

I feel that the concept of participatory decision-making is tricky
for scientists. Science, as a method of inquiry, is based on the idea
that there is a single result, a clear truth to be uncovered.

So then, scientists might have a natural tendency to think that
experts would always make the best decisions, and that these decisions
can be improved by increasing knowledge.

In the reality of public policy, on scales from family units to
nations to the global community, there is no objective best
policy. The consequences of each policy are dependent on the set of
values and opinions through which it is viewed. Essentially, people
make things complicated. The natural world can be shown to behave
according to certain laws. Approaches using game theory attempt to do
the same with humans, but it is clear that social and cultural
differences among humans affect their decision-making
preferences. Essentially, as a wealthy white male living in the UK I
am not in a position to define how the life of a woman in a
drought-afflicted African country would be best improved.

In reality there is no 'best' policy, only consequences affecting
different people in different ways. We need to map out these
consequences (making use of scientific information, of course) to make
an informed decision in a democratic fashion. This is why we need
participatory decision-making.
