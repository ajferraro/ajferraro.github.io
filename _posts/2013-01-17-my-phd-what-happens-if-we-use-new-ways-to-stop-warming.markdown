Yesterday I attempted to use the
[Up-Goer Five text editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) to summarise
what I do. It only allows you to use the thousand most common words in
the English language. This restriction often contorts language in odd
ways. I struggled because my description really does rely on using
certain technical words. Specifically, 'greenhouse gases' and
'aerosols'. I discovered that one can enclose technical words in
quotation marks to force the editor to allow them, but that seems a
bit like cheating.

In one sense, it doesn't matter what one calls things. The weakest
part of my attempt (below) is the confusing use of 'stuff' (which
causes warming) and 'other stuff' (which causes cooling). I suppose I
should have just written stuff A and stuff B. Unfortunately 'warming
stuff' wasn't allowed.

<blockquote>We make the air and the ground warmer by burning stuff
which goes into the air. This stuff stops the air cooling a bit . It
also changes winds and rain. Making the air warmer and changing winds
causes problems because we are used to things being as they are. There
are things to do to stop warming but we are not good at doing them. A
new idea to stop warming is to put other stuff high in the sky. It
might make it less warm but not in all places. Also, the winds and
rain might still change and so even if we put the other stuff in the
sky we still have to deal with changes. This is a problem. I want to
know how the changes from burning stuff are different from the changes
we get when we put the other stuff in the air to stop the warming. I
also want to know whether different types of stuff (which also stop
warming) change the winds and rain less. This will help us decide if
we want to put other stuff up there to stop warming.</blockquote>

I realised how simple the idea is. The details are hideously (and
perhaps prohibitively) complex, but the basics are all there. Writing
this summary was a good exercise. In real life I might not be so
restricted in vocabulary, but there are times when I am restricted by
time and the interest and knowledge level of the person listening to
me. Writing something like this is part of the all-important training
to clearly put out the required information.
