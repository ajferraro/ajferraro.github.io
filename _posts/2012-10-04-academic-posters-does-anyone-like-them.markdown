Today I presented a poster to members of my department as part of the
welcome programme for incoming PhD students. The idea is to give new
PhD students a flavour of what is going on in the department and where
they could end up in a couple of years, and to plant seeds for
collaboration. The poster session is a standard part of academic
conferences. People put up posters about their work for others to look
at. Some presenters loiter by their posters to give verbal summaries
and to answer questions.




Poster sessions are useful because it allows a large number of people
to present their work simultaneously and provides plenty of
opportunities for interaction with the most relevant people. An oral
presentation, by contrast, is principally a one-way flow of
information in a formal setting. Posters are more efficient at getting
information to those who need it.




But I don't like them.




When academics present posters they generally struggle to work out
what information really needs to go on it and what can be witheld. The
purpose of the poster determines the content. A poster is not an
academic paper on a single big sheet of paper. It is an illustrated
abstract. I use a poster to answer the following questions:






	
  1. What has this person done?

	
  2. Why is it important?

	
  3. Is it relevant to me?




I do not want details of the methology (unless the poster is about a
novel methodology, of course). I can find out about those details
should I want to, by asking you or by reading your paper. Your poster
is a concise, visual summary. Its purpose is to attract attention, not
to bore people by telling them everything you did. I suspect I have a
lower tolerance to this than others, but I don't bother looking at
most posters because they are walls of densely-packed text
interspersed with a few figures, written in a style which suggests it
has been lifted straight out of an academic paper and put into a
different layout. If the title sounds interesting enough and the
author is around I will ask them to explain their work to me verbally
instead. They usually explain it well and point to figures for
reference. They never point to the text. They render the vast majority
of the space on their poster superfluous. Don't bother including text
unless people are going to read it. If it is written in the same
manner as a paper or a book, they won't.




A poster should be _concise and visual__,_ and crucially, itÂ _need not
be rigorous_. I suspect some scientists would call me out on this
one. Academic papers should be written in great detail so others may
replicate the results. However, no one is going to use your poster to
replicate your results. Most of the time the detais of your
experimental setup does not provide answers to my three questions
above.




This post wouldn't be complete if I did not invite criticism of my own
poster. It is embedded at the top of this post. Please have a look and
see what you think. Does it do what you think a poster should?




UPDATE: The posters on display at the 'conference' were of excellent
quality. The key thing was: not too much text! That said, I think all
of them (mine included) could have been trimmed a bit. I also noticed
quite a few typographical errors in my poster. There are 6: a prize
(maybe) if you can spot them all!
