Start early. That is what PhD students are always told when it comes
to their thesis. But how early is that? And what does 'start' actually
mean? I'm going to argue that your thesis starts taking shape from the
moment you start your project, through the myriad choices and little
mistakes you make along the way. This is clearly only one approach -
one I espouse based on the path I took.




Start out with a list of questions you would like to address during
your PhD. See if you can build a 'story' out of them. In my case my
three results chapters form parts of a causal chain, which makes it
quite simple. You may have to work harder to find your story, but it
is worth it.

You should be doing this in your first year. Honestly. This is not to
sow panic among the ranks; my point is that your PhD thesis outline
naturally grows out of your project plan. By 'plan' I certainly do not
mean a timeline of future activities. Predicting when things will
happen in your project is nearly impossible. But think about where you
want to get with your project. Simply, what is the point? What
information are you trying to uncover and how will you present that
information in a convincing way? The image shows a basic plan I
sketched out within 6 months of starting my PhD. The plan needs to
cover three points:






	
  1. What are you going to do?

	
  2. How are you going to do it?

	
  3. Why is it awesome?




At the early stage I needed to work on point 3 and explain why my
approach is a novel one. Note how even then I had a three-section
structure which would fit nicely into my PhD thesis (in future posts
in this series we will see how it has gradually and subtly changed).




Your thesis is not the story of your PhD. It is a story _based on
_your PhD. You will not give a detailed chronological account of what
you did, but you will tell a story based on what you learned. Like any
story, it takes a while to get the plot elements in place. Play around
with them. Don't stress about it if they don't seem to make
sense. Come back to them later. By having a project plan you will
accomplish two things: you will make your work more focused because
you know what you are working towards, and you will have a ready-made
thesis outline.




I have made many adjustments to my plan and will no doubt make many
more. But this is no reason not to make a plan. Even if you don't know
your final destination you can at least ensure you head in the right
direction.
