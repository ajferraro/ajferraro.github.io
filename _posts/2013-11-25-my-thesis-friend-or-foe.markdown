Last Monday I submitted my PhD thesis. I walked over to the
Examinations Office in the centre of campus, up a few flights of
stairs, handed a big old pile of paper over to the secretary there,
signed a form, and that was it. I started my PhD in October 2010, and
according to my notebook I wrote the first few tentative words of my
thesis in June 2012.

I have heard others tell tales of the looming monstrosity their thesis
became in their life, constantly bearing down on them. The folk wisdom
of the PhD student is that your thesis is your enemy, and that every
day you have to do battle with it, to subjugate it and wrestle it into
some kind of coherent shape. To be honest, it never felt that way to
me. I followed the standard routine chapter by chapter:
[outline](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/thesis-writing-outlining/),
[concept map](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/thesis-writing-concept-maps/),
make figures, write text, proofread and edit, send to supervisors,
revise. When I started blogging I had planned to use it to describe
the process of writing a thesis as it happened: a
[‘stop-motion’ thesis](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/stop-motion-phd-thesis/),
as I called it then. It turns out that the process is a largely
uneventful one, churning through the routine described above.

Occasionally this process broke down. There were times when I felt
mentally and physically sluggish, so I took a short break - an
afternoon off, perhaps - to refocus. It helped that I was still doing
little bits of analysis quite late into my PhD. I had done enough to
be content, but had a few extra things that were worth doing since I
had some spare time. These tasks were pleasant distractions and
allowed me to keep my mind active without stressing it out with major
pieces of work with real and imminent deadlines. My thesis was never
my friend, but it wasn’t my enemy either.

So, for me at least, writing a thesis hasn’t been an epic climactic
undertaking. It’s been built up bit by bit, and I’ve worked without
putting myself under crippling pressure. I think the academic
environment here at the Department of Meteorology really helped: my
supervisors provided encouragement, advice and calming words when they
were needed, while the rich programme of seminars and group meetings
reminded me that I was also there to learn, not just to write a big
book and plonk it on someone’s desk.

As I walked back to my office after submitting my thesis I did feel
noticeably ‘lighter’. Although it hadn’t been a stressful experience,
getting rid of it still felt good. I am now free to do things for
their own sake, rather than the artificial goal of a document for
examination.

On the subject of examination, I still have my viva (or thesis
defence) ahead. In the UK this takes the form of an oral examination
by two examiners: the main one from another institution and the other
from one’s own (who also takes the role of a moderator). The candidate
is quizzed on the details of their thesis in order to check whether it
really is their own work and whether they have the depth of knowledge
befitting a PhD. It doesn’t sound like a pleasant experience but at
the same time I’m looking forward to discussing my work with
others. Much like the process of writing is pleasurable if one puts
aside the fact it’s for a thesis, I hope the process of discussion my
work will be pleasurable if I put aside the fact it determines whether
or not I get a PhD!
