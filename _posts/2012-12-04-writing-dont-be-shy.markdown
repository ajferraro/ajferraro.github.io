When I started my PhD I had a simple plan in my head for how I thought
it would go.

**Year 1: **Preliminary research, setting up the problem and gaining
  the knowledge base required to analyse my future results.

**Year 2**: Results come flooding in.

**Year 3**: Begin by pulling together the material I have generated
  and putting it into coherent form. A concentrated slog of writing,
  then I would be ready to submit.

Like all plans, it turned out to be wrong. It was probably useful in
some sense, but my project has not followed the trajectory I set out
in my head late in 2010. I actually had a substantial chunk of results
(enough to write a paper) by the end of my first year. My second year
was quite a barren time in terms of results, but highly
educational. Now, in my third year, I am writing parts of my thesis
before the model runs which will provide the bulk of two of the three
results chapters are even finished.

I ended up starting my thesis earlier than expected because I had had
some setbacks with the climate model I was using. Reading's IGCM is a
useful model but it has little documentation. Learning to use the
model had as much in common with the oral traditions of the Icelandic
sagas as it had with modern forms of written communication.

The long and short of it is that I had a lot of downtime while I was
waiting for model test runs to complete, restarting crashed runs and
so on. It took me around nine months from being introduced to the
model to completing the final 'results' runs. The final runs
themselves only took a month to run.

I found myself with some time on my hands. I could have done some
tangential reading, but I find it hard to stay focused that way, and I
don't think I'm particularly good at learning that way. I learn much
better with purpose behind me. For example, I learned a lot about
radiation modelling a few months ago when I was writing the section of
my thesis describing the code I was using, even though I had been
using it since late 2010. Having to write it down forced me to
re-examine what I did and didn't know and to ensure my knowledge was
up to scratch.

Early on in my PhD, while I was doing 'exploratory' reading and
research, my supervisors encouraged me to write little reports. They
told me it was good practice. Not only did it make me learn my stuff,
it also helped them stay up to speed with the literature using my
concise reviews. Also, some (but not all) of it could end up being
slotted straight into my thesis. I ended up writing a few of these
reports in my first two years. Some of them aren't much use. Either
the writing is too sloppy, or the results and/or analysis has
changed. But one - a review of microphysical processes affecting
sulphate aerosols - was indeed suitable to go straight into my
thesis. Bam. A whole subsection. Done. And I wrote it in my first
year!

I was also fortunate enough to have some interesting results by the
end of my first year. Encouraged by my supervisors, I wrote a short
[paper](http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2011/2011GL049761.shtml)
about them. It was exciting for a young researcher to have a
publication in a fine journal like _Geophysical Research
Letters_. Re-reading the paper today there are quite a few things I
would have changed. The figures could be improved and some of the
methodology is needlessly fiddly. Nevertheless, it was another
opportunity to write up a chunk of my future thesis. Even better, the
quality of the work was somewhat assured since it got through peer
review at GRL.

I have a spare couple of days while I run some diagnostics programs on
my model runs, so I am writing this material into my thesis. It's not
quite as seamless as I wanted. The style of a thesis is more
conversational than a paper (which is a shame - papers seem to be
required to be difficult to read sometimes), so need to change that. I
also have no space constraints, so I can expand on discussion if I
thnk it's appropriate. But even though I need to make changes, the
main ideas and the deep thought behind this chapter of my thesis has
already been done. It's a good feeling.

It is not always possible to write a paper during your PhD. Sometimes
it only comes together into a nice story later on. Nevertheless, I
think it's a very good idea to keep writing during your PhD. It helps
drill information into your mind and saves you some work later on. It
gives you a bit of variety in your everyday work. Your writing will
improve, and, who knows, you might even like it.
