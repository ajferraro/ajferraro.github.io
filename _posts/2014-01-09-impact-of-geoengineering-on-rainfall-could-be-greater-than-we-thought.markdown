I have a paper out today (with my PhD supervisors Ellie Highwood and
Andrew Charlton-Perez) which suggests that the impact of
geoengineering on rainfall in the tropics could be greater than we
thought.

Geoengineering is a proposed response to climate warming driven by
greenhouse gases. Basically, the idea is to mimic the effects of a
large volcanic eruption on the Earth’s climate by injecting tiny
particles called aerosols into the stratosphere. These particles would
reflect a small amount of the energy coming from the Sun, cooling the
planet. The basic idea makes sense, and from observing the climate
following volcanic eruptions we know it could provide some cooling.

It’s also well understood that using geoengineering to counteract the
warming effects of greenhouse gases and bring the surface temperature
down would
[reduce global rainfal](http://www.egu.eu/news/4/geoengineering-could-disrupt-rainfall-patterns/)l
to levels lower than those we would get if there was no geoengineering
or enhanced greenhouse gas levels. This is because the reduction in
solar energy reaching the surface means there is less energy available
to evaporate water, so the atmosphere has less water available to fall
as rain.

But my research suggests there’s another effect stratospheric aerosols
have on rainfall, especially in the Tropics. Here, rain is mainly
produced by towering convective clouds which transport heat energy up
from the surface to the atmosphere.

Our paper shows that aerosols in the stratosphere emit radiation down
into the troposphere below, interfering with this
convection. Geoengineering aerosols emit energy (in the form of
radiation, as shown in the picture above) downwards into the
troposphere, which causes the upper troposphere to warm up. In
essence, the heating from the aerosol increases the stability of the
tropical troposphere.

We don't see in the increase in stability when geoengineering is
represented by just turning down the Sun (right-hand panel in the
picture above) because there isn't any aerosol in the stratosphere to
emit radiation downwards\*.

This effect could be quite important depending on how strongly
aerosols interact with radiation in the way I just described. In my
climate model simulations I used one particular type of sulphate
aerosol with specific radiative properties. However, it’s possible
that aerosols in the real atmosphere could behave rather
differently. This research shows its important to get the aerosol
properties right if you want to correctly predict the effects of
stratospheric aerosol geoengineering on the climate.

It’s very difficult to know what the properties of geoengineering
aerosols in the real atmosphere might be. It’s not clear how much the
aerosols would ‘clump’ together, which would increase their size and
increase the amount of energy emitted into the troposphere. This is
important because the more energy emitted down into the troposphere,
the weaker tropical convection (and rainfall) becomes.

Geoengineering isn’t a ‘quick fix’ to the problem of
greenhouse-gas-driven climate change. We’ve know that for a long
time. This research shows that there are some important side-effects
of geoengineering which should be taken into account when thinking
about whether or not it’s a viable option. How important these sides
effects are depends on the size and properties of the aerosol, which,
as I’ve said, we don’t really know. In order to work how what
geoengineering does and doesn’t do, we’d have to crack the tricky
problem of understanding how the aerosols behave in the atmosphere.

_* EDIT: This is important. Solar dimming geoengineering to
counterbalance increasing CO2 concentrations decreases rainfall from
pre-industrial levels, but globally this is smaller than the increase
that would happen from CO2 alone. So in that sense solar dimming
geoengineering gets us closer to the pre-industrial
'baseline'. Including the aerosol effect on tropical rainfall,
however, shows that the reduction in rainfall from aerosol
geoengineering to counterbalance increasing CO2 concentrations is
about the same size as the increase that would happen from CO2
alone. So sulphate aerosol geoengineering to counteract CO2 takes us
about as far from the 'baseline' as CO2 alone does._
