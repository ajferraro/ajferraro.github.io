_Rain is grace; rain is the sky descending to the earth; without rain,
there would be no life. – _John Updike

Rain quenches the thirst of soils and vegetation, fuelling ecosystems
and much of the world’s agriculture. Whether it ruins a day on the
beach or destroys a season’s harvest, it makes humans deeply aware of
their vulnerability to the vagaries of the atmosphere. It’s important
to understand how rainfall changes in a changing climate. Here, I will
describe the issues in understanding precipitation changes and how two
recent papers help to solve the puzzle.

Predicting rainfall is difficult. It is a small-scale phenomenon,
especially in the towers of convective cloud in the Tropics. Weather
forecasting models are just beginning to capture them properly at
scales of a kilometre or so, but climate models, which have to be run
for decades rather than days, calculate atmospheric conditions on
scales of hundreds of kilometres. Rainfall has to be simplified in
these models, since we cannot calculate the physical properties of
individual clouds. These simplified representations are called
parameterisations. A precipitation parameterisation relates the
average rainfall over a large area to the average amount of water in
the air. Different models do this in different ways and, because it’s
a simplification, there is no definitive ‘right’ way. This means there
is some disagreement among climate models about how rainfall will
change in the future, especially in the Tropics (areas on the figure
which are not stippled).

If we think about precipitation in general theoretical terms, we can
find laws which must be followed and use them to make predictions, as
[Issac Held & Brian Soden](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI3990.1)
did in their study of
[how the hydrological cycle responds to global warming](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/ih0601.pdf). Rain
is caused by the upward transport of water vapour from the surface
into the atmosphere, where it condenses, forms clouds and rains
out. The amount of moisture going up must, of course, balance the
amount coming back down as rain.

As the climate warms, the amount of water vapour a fixed mass of air
can hold increases. This means that, as long as the circulations
transporting water upwards remain the same, the total amount of water
vapour going upwards must increase – which means the amount of rain
coming down must also increase. This is called the ‘rich get richer’
mechanism, because it increases rainfall in regions where there is
already a lot of rain driven by upward moisture transport. It’s a
fundamental mechanism driven by thermodynamic laws…but that doesn’t
mean it’s the only thing going on.

If climate model projections followed the ‘rich get richer’ mechanism,
precipitation would increase most in the regions with the most
precipitation currently. In fact it is more complicated than
that. [Robin Chadwick and his colleagues](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00543.1) explored
the effect of weaker vertical motions in a warmer climate. We can
understand this by thinking about what carbon dioxide does to the
vertical temperature profile. It warms the mid-troposphere (about 5 km
up) more than the surface. To get convective upward motion, the air at
the surface must be less dense (i.e. warmer) than the air
above. Warming the air aloft suppresses this motion. The Chadwick
decomposition calculates the part of the precipitation changes caused
by changes in moisture (which goes at about 7% per K) and the part
caused by the reduction in upward transport. They find the two tend to
roughly cancel each other out, which means the spatial shifts in
precipitation are determined by changing patterns of surface
temperature (since warm surfaces produce upward motion).

[Sandrine Bony and her team](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1799.html)
decompose precipitation changes into two main components rather than
three: one is the ‘dynamical’ component, associated with changing
upward motions, and the other is the ‘thermodynamical’ component,
including changes in atmospheric moisture content. Unlike the Chadwick
method, the thermodynamical component is not designed solely to
represent the ‘rich get richer’ mechanism. This means the
thermodynamical component isn’t just a 7% per K increase; it includes
things like the spatial changes in surface temperature. The dynamical
component isolates the change in precipitation caused by changes in
upward motion.

The ‘rich get richer’ rule of thumb becomes increasingly irrelevant at
smaller scales. This is frustrating, because these are the scales we
really care about! It’s not particularly useful knowing what will
happen in a general sense over the whole Tropical region. Farmers want
to know what will happen to the seasonal rains on their small piece of
land.

Bony also points out that geoengineering schemes which aim to reduce
incoming solar radiation to cool the planet’s surface would leave the
dynamical component of precipitation change untouched. This is because
the dynamical component is caused by the warming of the
mid-troposphere by carbon dioxide, and this remains even if we cool
the surface. It is an example of the inexact nature of the
cancellation between carbon dioxide increases and geoengineering
schemes to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
and demonstrates that the only way to stop carbon dioxide-driven
climate change properly is to stop emitting carbon dioxide.

Bony and Chadwick’s decompositions show how one can glean a lot more
information from climate model projections than one would expect from
first glance. We have established some general facts about climate
change related to the Earth’s energy budget. In that sense we
understand quite well what will happen in a warming climate. However,
there is still a lot of diversity between model projections, most of
which comes from differences in the dynamical response. Local changes
in rainfall are related to changes in circulation, and this is the
area in which a lot more work needs to be done.
