Near the start of my PhD I began hearing a lot of buzz around a book
by a guy called Randy Olson called
[_Don't Be Such a Scientist_](http://www.dontbesuchascientist.com/). First
off, what a great title! It grabbed me immediately. I find myself
saying that exact phrase in my head (sometimes to others, and
sometimes to myself!). Time to investigate,
then.

Second thing - [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Olson),
who I had never heard of before, has had a pretty unique
career. Starting off in academia and gaining a professorship in marine
biology, he gradually transferred to Hollywood where he threw himself
way out of his comfort zone, took acting classes and ended up making
some rather successful films. Surprisingly, I hadn't actually heard of
any of them before reading this book, but now I'll be sure to check
them out.

Somehow the book sat on my 'to read' list for a long time. Finally,
now I'm wrapping up my PhD work and my brain is a little less
frazzled, I'm doing some more reading for pleasure. So I picked up a
copy of _Don't Be Such a Scientist _from my university library.

### What's it all about?

It's not immediately obvious what it's about, actually. Its subtitle,
'talking substance in an age of style', drops some clues, but for
reasons I'll come on to I think it's rather misleading. The back of my
edition lacks a blurb - it has a short author biography and some
rave-review quotations from various eminent people.

I see the book as a dose of perspective for those who have been
closeted in their own intellectual community for so long they believe
that's all there is. It argues that, for scientists to successfully
communicate with other intellectual communities, they must learn to
speak their languages, and, in short, not be such scientists.

He expresses his position particularly vividly in relation to
scientists' default mode of suspicion and criticism:

>>You meet scientists who have lost control of this negating approach
>and seem to sit and stew in their overly critical, festering juices
>of negativity, which can reduce down to a thick, gooey paste of
>cynicism.

As you can see, Olson also makes an effort to be provocative, because
that sets up tension, and maintains interest, and that's a crucial
part of good communications.

### Tensions, tensions everywhere

Talking of tensions, the book repeatedly bumps into the tension
between substance and style. Olson argues it's very difficult to have
both. An engaging film generally has to be lighter on information. For
this reason, film is more of an engagement tool and a motivational
medium than one that's directly educational. Real learning requires
repetition, detail and focus, none of which are particularly
entertaining. Scientists generally find it difficult to reduce
information content. I have lost count of the number of times I have
heard scientists say that they are struggling to condense a talk down
to the required time, or to keep a publication below a page limit. A
key lesson from the book, then, is to think carefully about what the
audience really needs to know, and impose some self-discipline.

This is why I find the subtitle of the book misleading. It claims to
be about substance, but really it's all about the style. I found it
never really touched on ways to craft writing or film in such a way to
keep maximise actual useful information while retaining the audience.

### Making headway in the attention economy

I had one other major problem with the book. If I were to take up all
its suggestions it would feel to me a little like admitting
defeat. Olson talks about how style of communication completely
defines our age because humans are so overloaded with stimuli. There
are so many media sources clamouring for attention. He describes an
'attention economy' which works on these terms. In the attention
economy we must scrabble to glean a few moments of attention and we
can't waste that by imparting information. We can only afford to give
off a general impression and hope it sticks.

It left me wondering: when Olson talks about science communication,
what is he communicating? His goal is to catch the person's attention
for a moment and implant a seed in their brain that makes them want to
know more. That's the initial 'hump' to get over with communication -
arousing interest.

This is excellent practical advice, but it made me a little
sad. Personally I think the 'attention economy' is troubling. I feel
like some communications barely communicate anything at all and are
just stimuli devoid of meaning. I feel like the search for attention
amidst fading attention spans favours a simplistic approach which
doesn't reflect the nuances of the real world. We see this every time
a politician says...well...anything. I do my best not to fall into the
trap of the attention economy, but feel it every day. Often at work I
find it difficult to concentrate because the Internet is luring me in:
Twitter, Facebook, superficial arguments on online fora, YouTube
videos, banal rolling news...for me, it's a bad thing which encourages
lazy thinking. In that sense, I think non-scientists would benefit
from a little scientific thinking. Or at least some scepticism when it
comes to the claims of those in powerful positions in our society. But
making the public think like scientists is a harder task than making
scientists think like the public.

### It's not a manual, it's a demonstration

In the end, that's what the book is about. It makes a case for
scientists learning how other people think. It does so in a light way
focusing on a simple message delivered in an engaging style. One might
be able to make the case by reviewing the sociological literature on
sub-cultures with different psychologies and linguistics, and impeded
communications between isolated intellectual communities. Olson does
it rather more succinctly with wit, storytelling and occasional
overgeneralisation.

I don't know anything about communications strategy and I'm sure there
are all sorts opaque, technical ways to learn about it. Olson sees
this and uses this book as a real-life example of communicating
technical ideas in an engaging and motivational way. Writing this blog
post has helped me understand this. In short, I didn't realise how
much I was learning.
