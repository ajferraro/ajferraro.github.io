In my habitual Friday-afternoon wanderings around the Internet I came
across an interesting workshop being run at the AGU Fall Meeting next
week. It's called
[FameLab: Exploring Earth and Beyon](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/events/famelab-exploring-earth-and-beyond/)d. The
AGU session page is very brief. It says:

>  _Come listen as young scientists aspiring to be the next Jane
> Goodall or N__eil deGrasse Tyson share their passion for science in
> three minutes or less at ‘FameLab: __Explorin__g Earth & Beyond.’
> This science take on “American Idol” has 10 performers giving
> PowerPoint-free talks meant to engage all audiences._ </blockquote>

FameLab in the USA is a joint venture from NASA and National
Geographic. After a bit of Googling I discovered that it's essentially
a national heat for an
[international competition](http://famelab.org/about-us/international-final-2012). It
turns out FameLab is an established project which has been running
since 2007, encouraging young scientists to develop and use their
communication skills to connect with the rest of society.

Initially I was rather sceptical of this project. The name made it
sound like an outlet for those seeking validation for their inflated
egos. I asked myself whether that would appeal to real scientists. I
quickly scotched this train of thought. Scientists are just
people. Some people crave fame more than others. It's a very human
thing to seek recognition, though some go to greater lengths than
others, and some deserve it more than others. The FameLab website
describes some 'performances':

>  _Some played it straight, some were slick and a few were downright
> eccentric. One contestant waved around tennis balls dressed in
> colourful wigs to hi__ghlight his point about polymer
> chemistry. Another jumped on a chair and performed pirouettes to
> animate his arcane research on spinning electrons. A third confessed
> that her props had been confiscated by customs and went on to
> threaten me with a gun that fires needles ("Yes, it could have been
> disastrous" she confessed afterwards)._ </blockquote>

I was drawn in. FameLab seems to be a fine way to encourage innovation
in science communication. Some people are well-suited to the role of
the entertainer-scientist (or, as I referred to them in a previous
post, the
[celebrity scientist](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/climate-science-what-makes-it-exciting/)). Others
are not, and I think it's a mistake to think that every scientist can
make their work fun and accessible for everyone. Some science is very
hard to make appealing to a non-technical audience. Nevertheless, when
an energetic and empathetic person combines with an interesting and
relevant subject, an entertainer-scientist can result.

I think these people are entertainers first and foremost. They might
have scientific credentials, but their primary role is to get
non-technical audiences to listen to them, and sometimes that requires
quite ruthless abstractions of the science. Brian Cox, Britain's
foremost entertainer-scientist, made this quite clear in a
[comment](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12733793) about
the use of loud music during his TV programmes:

> It should be a cinematic experience - it's a piece of film on
> television, not a lecture...it [music] lends a lot of emotion and
> more depth.

Here he is not speaking as a scientist. In that guise he wouldn't
allow himself to include the word 'emotion'. He is speaking as a
communicator of science. He recognises the importance of 'emotion' in
the way most people think, most of the time. FameLab looks like a fine
initiative to bring at least some of the great discoveries of science
to the widest audience possible.

If I had one complaint, it's that this approach to science
communication focuses a little too much on the 'wonder' and the
'mystery' of it all. This is understandable, because these are
emotionally appealing concepts. But a real strength of science is its
critical, sceptical approach. Science teaches the ability to analyse
claims, seek for evidence, test claims against available evidence, and
modify opinions accordingly. I think there is a tremendous social
benefit to getting people to acknowledge the cultural filters which
remove 'inconvenient' facts and attempt to circumvent them. Imagine
the attitude of a critcally-thinking public to the inherently biased
journalism we face every day. People will start to check multiple
sources to examine stories through different cultural 'lenses' and
attempt to get at the facts behind the story, filtering out the noise
and the ideologies of those who claim to be presenting the
truth. 'Rationality' isn't some kind of panacea for social problems,
but I think the scientific approach applied to other areas of life
could be very beneficial.
