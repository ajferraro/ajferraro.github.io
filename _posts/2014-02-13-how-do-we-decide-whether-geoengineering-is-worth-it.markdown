Some have proposed we take a different approach to climate change and
attempt to stop global warming by reflecting sunlight. We have a new
paper out today which asks the question: how do we decide whether such
geoengineering would be effective?

### Does geoengineering have the potential to reduce climate risk?

One way to exert a cooling influence on the climate would be to pump
tiny particles up into the stratosphere, where they would reflect a
small amount of the Sun's energy. Should we consider intentionally
modifying our environment in this way in order to affect the climate?
Some argue there is a chance of unintended side effects, and that such
meddling is too risky. Others argue the opposite: that it is too risky
to allow global warming to continue.

What are these risks? A basic way to think about it is that people are
adapted to our present climate. They are used to a particular mix of
warm and cold, wet and dry. As climate changes, this mix will also
change, posing a risk to those not prepared for it. For example, a
warmer climate might be seen as a risk for healthcare systems not
equipped to deal with medical problems associated with heat waves. A
wetter climate might increase the risk of flooding. Risks like this
could be costly - which is essentially why climate change could pose a
problem.

Could geoengineering be used to help? Geoengineering with
stratospheric aerosols might pose risks of its own:
[reduced rainfall](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50868/abstract),
[depletion of the ozone layer](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JD020566/abstract). It
might also produce benefits:
[reduced warming](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50646/abstract)
and
[enhanced agricultural productivity](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n2/full/nclimate1373.html). We
need a way to compare the risks and benefits of geoengineering with
the risks and benefits of not geoengineering (here, we are assuming we
don't do a good job of reducing greenhouse gas emissions).

### How do we weigh up different kinds of risk?

Consider this: you are diagnosed with a medical condition which may
deteriorate in future and cause you difficulty. You are given the
option of a treatment which might stop the symptoms of the disease but
may also have other side-effects. Do you take the treatment? You have
to weigh up the risks.

description=A matrix showing the different outcomes of geoengineering. On the horizontal axis is the probability of a big climate change under carbon dioxide. On the vertical axis is the probability of a big change in climate under geoengineering. %}

In the same way we have to weigh up the risks to decide whether
geoengineering is worthwhile. We would want it to reduce climate risk
compared to not geoengineering. But there's another layer of
complexity here. Perhaps the reduction in risk happens somewhere that
wasn't actually at high risk of big climate changes in the first
place. So perhaps no one cares?

We looked at this by dividing climate risk into four possible
outcomes, shown in the diagram on the left. The horizontal axis shows
the chance of getting a substantial climate change in the first place
from carbon dioxide. The vertical axis shows the chance of getting a
substantial change from geoengineering. So, if geoengineering reduces
climate risk but there wasn't much risk to start with (low change of
substantial climate change on the horizontal axis). we classify
geoengineering as 'benign' (it hasn't really done much). If
geoengineering reduces risk where carbon dioxide increases risk we
classify geoengineering as 'effective'. But what if geoengineering
increases risk? We classify it as 'ineffective' if geoengineering
introduces climate risk in a similar manner to carbon
dioxide. Finally, if geoengineering introduces climate risk into areas
which were not previously at risk from carbon dioxide-driven climate
change, we classify geoengineering as 'damaging'.

This way of looking at things can be used to classify climate
changes. The maps in this post give an example: temperature and
precipitation from a climate model. The 'global warming' case involves
a climate with levels of carbon dioxide four times what we have now,
and a climate about 4 degrees C warmer. The 'geoengineering' case uses
stratospheric aerosols to counterbalance this warming. So as expected,
if you look at temperature, geoengineering is largely effective. But
rainfall looks rather different. Geoengineering is not effective in
quite large parts of the globe.

### Trade-offs

We have made some subjective choices here, and different choices would
give quite different results as to the effectiveness of
geoengineering. To further complicate things, I would expect different
climate models to paint quite different pictures of regional changes.

Geoengineering isn't necessarily good or bad. It involves a trade-off
between risks. These risks are different for different aspects of
climate. As these (and many previous) results have shown, it might not
be a good idea to use geoengineering to counterbalance all warming,
because this would produce large rainfall changes. Approaches like the
one described here could be used to find what the optimum level of
geoengineering is that would minimise changes in both temperature and
rainfall.
