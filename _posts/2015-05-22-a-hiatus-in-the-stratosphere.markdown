**During the past few decades the rate at which the Earth's surface has been warming has decreased. This has been called a 'pause' or 'hiatus' in global warming. At the same time, the cooling of the lower stratosphere has similarly paused. What's going on here? Now is a good time to review what we know about drivers of temperatures in different parts of the atmosphere.**

Carbon dioxide has a warming effect on the surface and the troposphere (the lowest 10 km or so of the atmosphere) because it absorbs infrared radiation, reducing the amount of energy the troposphere can emit to space. But higher up in the stratosphere (between about 10 and 50 km) carbon dioxide actually has a cooling effect. [The ](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/3ICESM/3ICESM-230.pdf)[reason](http://scienceofdoom.com/2010/04/18/stratospheric-cooling/) [for this is](http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2011/09/04/why-does-the-stratosphere-cool/) a bit subtle, but it can essentially be thought of as a result of thin air at high altitudes, which means a lot of the emission from the stratosphere at the wavelengths at which carbon dioxide absorbs is straight out to space; in the troposphere on the other hand there is more reabsorption.

## The strange case of the two hiatuses

Since 1979 we've been able to [measure](http://www.remss.com/measurements/upper-air-temperature) the temperature of the stratosphere using satellite instruments. The lower stratosphere cooled until the mid-1990s, but since then its temperature has barely changed. This flattening of lower stratospheric cooling is happening at the same time as the flattening of surface warming. That's a little odd - surface warming has paused, and stratospheric cooling has paused as well! Are these things somehow linked? Just looking naively at the temperature data one might be forgiven for thinking something is wrong with our theories of what carbon dioxide does to the atmosphere.

I have a [correspondence piece](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2624) out today in Nature Climate Change with coauthors [Mat Collins](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/mc369) and [Hugo Lambert](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/fhl202) explaining this little mystery and reviewing some of the great scientific work on understanding drivers of stratospheric temperature change. The ['pause'](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/news/recent-pause-in-warming) in global surface warming has attracted a [lot](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sgs02rpa/research/DEEP-C.html#PAPERS) of attention in recent years, and appears to be mostly a result of natural variations in the amount of heat being taken into the ocean, but at the same time there has been plenty of important scientific research on stratospheric temperature trends that has received rather less attention.

In short, the answer is that the two 'hiatuses' are not related to each other, and neither are inconsistent with the scientific basis of global warming by increasing carbon dioxide concentrations.

## What drives stratospheric temperature change?

It turns out the main cause of lower stratospheric cooling since 1979 is not carbon dioxide. This is mainly because the lower stratosphere is not very sensitive to a change in carbon dioxide concentrations. It has a much greater effect higher up (the 'middle stratosphere' line in the figure above shows strong cooling over the period for which measurements are available). The cooling effect is still there, but it's not the main culprit for past changes.

The missing piece is what's been happening to stratospheric ozone. Ozone absorbs solar radiation and warms the air, which means ozone-rich parts of the stratosphere are actually warmer than the upper parts of the troposphere.

Emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other similar substances have caused the amount of ozone in the stratosphere to decline over past decades. The declining ozone meant less solar radiation was absorbed, so the stratosphere cooled down. It has also led to an increase in harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun reaching the surface. Concern about the damage to the ozone layer led to international regulations on the emissions of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances, starting with the Montreal Protocol in 1989. Now the ozone layer is beginning to show signs of recovery.

So it is ozone, not carbon dioxide, that has been the main driver of lower stratospheric cooling since 1979. The flattening out of the stratospheric cooling trend is because ozone levels have stopped declining.

## A delicate balance for the future

Does that mean that, as the ozone layer recovers, we should expect the lower stratosphere to warm up again in the future? In fact it's a little more complicated than that. Although carbon dioxide isn't the main cause of past stratospheric cooling, if we keep emitting it at an accelerating rate its effects will start to become more important. In the future we might see carbon dioxide becoming a major influence on the temperature of the lower stratosphere.

Although we know that carbon dioxide causes stratospheric cooling and ozone causes stratospheric warming, the size of their effects is very complicated to calculate. It depends not just on the effects of these substances on radiation but on complex interactions with the atmospheric circulation, and in the case of ozone is also heavily dependent on complex chemical reactions.

This means climate model projections simulate a broad range of possible future temperature trends. The figure shows differences in lower-stratospheric temperature relative to the 1990s in simulations with 8 climate models including the detailed descriptions of changing stratospheric chemistry that are required to accurately simulate changes in ozone. The black bars show the combined effects of both greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide) and ozone-depleting substances (mainly CFCs). The coloured bars show their individual contributions. The simulations show ozone-depleting substances were the main drivers of past stratospheric cooling. In the future the models simulate a large range of influences.

What all this means is that the future of lower stratospheric temperature will be determined by a tug-of-war between the warming influence of recovering ozone and the cooling influence of increasing carbon dioxide. It is actually difficult to work out which of these effects will win out. It's even possible they could cancel each other out and the period of constant lower-stratospheric temperatures could continue for decades. In contrast, the period of flat surface temperatures is likely to end in the next few years, and we are very confident it will end with a period of warming ([likely ](http://www.rtcc.org/2015/02/24/global-warming-likely-to-accelerate-after-pause-say-scientists/)[accelerated](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n4/full/nclimate2531.html) [warming ](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27012-burst-of-warming-may-end-lull-in-rising-temperatures.html#.VR6NnvnF9cE)as heat is transferred from the oceans to the atmosphere).
