The results are in! Over the past month I have been logging my work
patterns. I explained my motivation in a
[post](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/work-life-balance-of-a-phd-student-an-experiment/)
before I started. I wanted to know how long I spent working, and what
I was doing during working hours. The question was: can a PhD student
get away with just working 9-5?

The answer is, broadly, yes.

#### How long do I spend working?

On an average working day I spent **8.57 hours** 'at work'. This is
rather loosely defined, but essentially it means I am either at my
desk on somewhere else on the university campus. I am not actually
doing anything PhD-related for 2.17 of those hours. That brings my
**daily work time** down to** 6.4 hours**.

Before I began, I estimated that I would spend 6 hours a day
working. I may have overestimated my actual work time because I tended
to round my working half-hours up (see the Methods section below).

The graph above shows the number of hours worked per day. The 8-hour
line represents the standard length of a 9-5 working day. Some days
were rather unproductive with large amounts of time 'greyed out' where
no work was done. You can see at the start of the month, coming back
from Christmas, I was very keen. I even did some reading on the
weekend. Later on my working time waned slightly. You can also see
that the second Friday was a very short working day. It snowed that
day and I was finding it difficult to concentrate so I took the
afternoon off!

#### What was I doing?

I spent the **biggest** chunk of my time **coding**. This applies to
making plots as well as analysing data. Since climate modelling is
necessarily computer-based, it's no surprise coding comes out on
top. Next comes my 'nowork' category, which I discussed above. I had
just over **two hours off per day**. I rarely take clearly-defined
lunch and tea breaks, but I suppose these two hours can represent
them. In reality those hours were spent procrastinating on the
Internet or doing other things not related to my PhD. This includes
organisational tasks like booking transport to meetings and
conferences, maintaining websites, and so on.

'Understanding' covered research I did with a specific purpose, like
finding out how to do a particular type of analysis, or comparing my
results with others. This explains why the time I spent 'reading' was
comparatively small. My purposeful research obviously involved plenty
of reading. The 'reading' category was specifically for reading new
and interesting papers to develop my background knowledge, rather than
to find a specific piece of information.

I was surprised how much time I spent in meetings. I think the
proportion is artificially large because the Department held a
Research Day in early January, when representatives of research groups
give summaries of their work to the rest of the Department. Then
again, I only went to an afternoon's worth of talks. I value
meetings. Obviously those with my supervisors are very important, but
seminars are an excellent way to broaden my education. Recently I have
also been thinking about acquiring new skills for analysis, and one of
the best ways to learn about these is through seminars.

Finally, the 'writing' part: it's very small, but that is because I
haven't really started my thesis in earnest yet. If I was at a loose
end I would do a short stint adding some material or reorganising what
I already had.

#### There is enough time

These results have shown that I **haven't been overly efficient**
during working hours. I don't work very hard (in terms of work out
versus time in), and yet my output is reasonable, as is the quality of
my work. I worked slightly over the standard 8-hour day, but if I
really wanted to I could trim this down without sacrificing quantity
or quality. In fact, I might gain productivity by constraining my
working day, because I'm likely to become less lazy and less easily
distracted.

#### Methods

I used a Google Doc
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At2X4JkfK94EdFI2cWd6bnpDOGZhcHVkLXhlQjFFYWc&usp=sharing)
to record the time spent at work. I recorded my predominant activity
in half-hour blocks. Work doesn't fall neatly into blocks like this so
I had to do some subjective re-jigging. For example, if I start work
at 9:15, so I write in the 9:00 - 9:30 slot that I did some work? I
went by the rule of thumb that, if I worked for more than half the
time in the slot, I would record it. I categorised my time as follows:

  * understanding - active research, including reading, to find out
    specific things

	
  * coding - making plots or running models

	
  * meeting - talking to other scientists

	
  * writing - thesis or other smaller piece of writing; blog posts

	
  * reading - reading papers and other articles without a
    clearly-defined purpose

	
  * nowork - breaks, organisational stuff, admin

I think there is more information to be pulled out here. I actually
find it quite interesting to just look at the colour-coded allocation
of time in my spreadsheet rather than the graphs above. One can pick
out, by eye, that I tend to do coding in long, uninterrupted blocks. I
find it easier when I have got into the 'flow'; plus it is simply
time-consuming. Please do take a look at the
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At2X4JkfK94EdFI2cWd6bnpDOGZhcHVkLXhlQjFFYWc&usp=sharing). I
would be interested in hearing comments on the results or the method,
since I may be trying this again in the future!
