Writing is thesis is often the PhD student's least favourite part of
their project. I beg to differ. I very much enjoy putting things down
on paper. I often write short reports on key topics I am trying to get
my head round. If I can't explain it in writing, I don't understand it
properly. It's a useful test to get around the brain's tendency to get
a bit lazy and pretend to understand things when it doesn't.




It is common wisdom in academia that the only people who will read
your thesis will be the people who have to: your supervisors and
examiners. Often the same material is available in a more manageable
packed in the papers a PhD student produces. Why, then, should I care
about my thesis? Because it tests the student's ability to link up
their research and place it in the correct place in the broad canvas
of their research field. A paper is an easy task in comparison because
of its narrow focus. PhDs are also about breadth of knowledge and
understanding, and your thesis will be a flop if you do not possess
this ability to put everything together, in its appropriate place, and
discuss its significance.




There are plenty of guides out there for writing a thesis. A simple
Google search will furnish you with more than enough of that, and I
find they are often pretty similar. I find them somewhat useful, but
there is only so much abstract advice that I can use. I find it
helpful to learn through real examples. This post is the first in a
series documenting the growth of my thesis, from its very earliest
stages. The aim is to analyse my writing process as I am doing it,
hopefully improving it, and in the process putting together a useful
resource for others. I don't know entirely how this will turn out. It
may turn into a simple linear narrative discussing sections as they
are written, or it may become a series of features on specific
techniques I found useful. Much like the thesis itself, I have a rough
vision for what I want to achieve, but the end result will be
something different, messier and richer than I can imagine.
