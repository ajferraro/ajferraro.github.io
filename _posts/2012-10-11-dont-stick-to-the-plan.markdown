>  Plans are useless, but planning is everything.

>  _- Dwight D. Eisenhower_

I failed to take my own advice today. I wrote a substantial part of my
thesis section on a climate model I am using without planning it. No
[outline](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/thesis-writing-outlining/),
no
[concept map](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/thesis-writing-concept-maps/),
nothing.

Sticking rigidly to the plan rarely works because you made your plan
in your head and the real world doesn't work the same as the one in
there. That doesn't mean planning is useless. Aspects of your plan
might go awry, but it is unlikely to be entirely wrong. The plan helps
formulate the problem clearly in your head and provide a path
forward. You might deviate from the inital path, but it helps to have
a few points of reference along the way (especially at the start).

In my defence, this section was a simple one. I was comparing the
output from the
[IGCM](http://www.meteo.mcgill.ca/bourqui-wiki/doku.php?id=welcome)'s
simulation of the present-day climate with observational and
reanalysis data. I had already made all my figures; all I had to do
was talk about them. Model assessment is rarely an exciting part of
scientific writing. It is necessary, but there are no exciting results
to present and discuss. This section answers the question 'is the
model alright?'. The answer is 'yes, just about'.

In my thesis I have to be more rigorous than that, but the writing is
more or less a simple description of the plots and a little discussion
of whether the biases in the model are serious problems or not. I had
put a little thought into this already and had a list of a few
references I needed to include, so in a sense I had planned a little
bit.

To write a detailed plan and concept map like I did for, say, the
ethical and social subsection, would have been like using a
sledgehammer to crack a nut. The ethical and social section was a
foray into an area outside my expertise and was something which
required a structured argument. The section on model assessment was
comparatively simple to write. I noted this in advance and changed my
plan accordingly. The section might need some proof-reading as a
result, but in general the 'Models & Methods' section of any thesis is
'menial' work which doesn't require too much difficult thought.
