Last week's Royal Meteorological Society
[National Meeting](http://www.rmets.org/events/lessons-climate-and-modelling-palaeo-record)
took us on a whirlwind tour of the Earth's climate in the deep past.

In his introduction,
[Alan Haywood](http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.haywood) described
the timescales on which palaeo studies operate. Most of the Earth's
past has been spent in a
'[Greenhouse World](http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Mapping/greenhse/grnhouse.htm)'
state, where there is no ice anywhere on the planet. The palaeo record
takes us back to the Greenhouse World and the time of the dinosaurs,
40-80 million years ago. Then, 15 million years ago, ice began to grow
at the poles and the Earth became an 'Icehouse World'. Note this is
not the same as an 'Ice Age'. We are in the Icehouse World right now,
because there is ice at the poles, but the ice extent is much lower
than in an Ice Age.

Studying climate data from these periods can give us useful
information about how the Earth's climate system behaves. Crucially,
as Alan Haywood pointed out, they provide an 'out of sample test' for
climate models. Observations of the present-day and the recent past
are used in the development of climate models, since a bare minimum
requirement is that it should simulate the main recognisable features
of the present-day Earth. One must be careful when comparing the
results from climate models to these observations because the same
observations could have been used in developing the model, generating
a false sense of confidence in the model. Palaeo data are generally
not used in model development.

There are some disadvantages to using palaeo data. The data themselves
are often quite uncertain, and the coverage across the global can be
very sparse indeed. These data aren't really observations. They are
based on _proxies_ - indicators of previous climates such as remnants
of tiny animals and bubbles trapped deep in ice sheets. Observations
do not offer a gold-standard absolute truth. In reality, observations
themselves are uncertain and this must be taken into account. The
problem of observational uncertainty becomes even greater for the deep
past. Several times during the meeting this theme emerged: if a model
is shown to be different from proxy-derived observations, this isn't
necessarily evidence that the model is wrong. The best truth we can
arrive at lies in a subtle synthesis of evidence from both models and
proxies.

[Aisling Dolan](http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~eeamd/) (University
of Leeds) presented some multi-model simulations of the climate during
the Pliocene (around 3 million years ago) from the
[PlioMIP](http://geology.er.usgs.gov/eespteam/prism/prism_pliomip.html)
project (Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project). She showed that
there were substantial discrepancies between the models and proxies
and among models themselves. The uncertainties in the models and the
proxies were large enough to explain this discrepancy. This is one of
those - irritatingly common - situations in climate science where
little information can be gleaned. The large uncertainties don't mean
the models and proxies agree: merely that they cannot be said to be
inconsistent with each other.

She mentioned something interesting about the PlioMIP experimental
design. The point of a 'MIP' is the run different models under exactly
the same setup so we can understand where models disagree and
hopefully work out why. The PlioMIP setup involves using constant
concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar activity and so on. These
constant values represent an average over a long period. But, as
Aisling pointed out, our observations of the Pliocene don't represent
an average over a long period of time. For example, the average carbon
dioxide concentration used in PlioMIP could represent the
concentration 3 million years ago, while the average solar activity
could look like 3.2 million years ago. So we are not really giving
models a fair chance here.

[Matthew Pound](http://www.northumbria.ac.uk/sd/academic/ee/ee_about_us/eestaff/m_pound)
(University of Northumbria) spoke about the Miocene, a very
interesting period in the record where there were potentially low
carbon dioxide concentrations but a very warm climate. He found that a
model could not reproduce Miocene vegetation using low carbon
dioxide. Once again, though, he pointed out the huge uncertainty in
the measurements of carbon dioxide during this period. One
reconstruction of global carbon dioxide concentrations in the Miocene
puts them at 400 ppmv - at which level the model does a reasonable
job.

'Not inconsistent'...uncertainties strike again. But it is often the
job of science to accurately determine the level of our ignorance
rather than the level of our knowledge.

Palaeo data can help us understand the sensitivity of the Earth's
climate to changes in carbon
dioxide. [Mat Collins](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/mc369)
(University of Exeter) spoke about using these data to calculate this
sensitivity. The IPCC express it as a global-mean temperature change
for a doubling of carbon dioxide, and put the likely range at 2 to 4.5
degrees C. He noted an interesting conflict: palaeo data suggest
climate sensitivity is rather high, whereas recent observations
suggest it is on the low end of the IPCC range. There is still plenty
to be done on the climate sensitivity issue.

The meeting closed with a panel discussion which summarised the day's
talks and gave the speakers a change to agree or disagree as they
pleased. It was a fascinating discussion: informal, yet
well-structured, engaging and informative. Probably the single best
section of any RMetS meeting I have been to, in fact. Some of the
discussion centred on the idea of finding, sometime in the past, an
analogue for the climate of the present or the near-future. The idea
is that, by studying the history of this period, we can gain some
insights into current climate and how it may change. The problem here
is that it is very unlikely that such an analogue exists. Humans have
altered the Earth's chemistry and biology in such novel ways that we
leave quite a unique signature on the planet - leading some to call
this age the
'[Anthropocene](https://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/the-age-we-made/)'. [Ed Hawkins](http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~ed/home/index.html),
a scientist from my Department who was also at the meeting, added
another point on Twitter.

Most of the time, the climate of the past varied quite slowly, and so
at any point in time we could say the climate was roughly in
equilibrium. In reality the climate always changes slightly, but most
of the time it exists in a relatively stable state. Compare this to
the present-day. We know the present climate is very much not in
equilibrium, and the changes are likely to become more rapid in the
future. Studying equilibrium climates (which may remain stationary for
long time periods) may not tell us what we need to know about climate
changes over short timescales.
