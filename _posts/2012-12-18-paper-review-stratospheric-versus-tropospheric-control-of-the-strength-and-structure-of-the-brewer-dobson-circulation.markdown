The stratosphere lies above the troposphere (which is where most
'weather' happens) between about 10-50 km altitude. Its circulation is
in many ways counter-intuitive, thanks mainly to the influence of
waves.

**Wave** motions are ever-present in the atmosphere on a huge variety
  of scales - from turbulent eddies to thousand-kilometre planetary
  waves. They can basically be understood as motions which dump
  momentum (which changes the wind speed) when they break. Think of
  waves surging onshore at the beach. Out at sea, the wave doesn't
  actually move water horizontally. It just moves water up and
  down. The wave moves but the water doesn't. As the shore gets closer
  and the sea shallower, the wave breaks and water rushes
  forward. Edwin Gerber's paper describes the behaviour of the
  wave-driven Brewer-Dobson circulation in the stratosphere.

The Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) transports air poleward from the
tropics. This happens because waves from the troposphere are produced
by mountains (think about putting a rock in a stream and imagine the
swirls this produces), move up into the stratosphere and break. This
breaking decreases the wind speed and air drifts towards the pole and
then sinks. This is because of the principle of **conservation of
angular momentum**. Basically, if you are spinning in a computer chair
really fast, you will find it difficult to pull your arms in. If you
slow down (imagine this is the effect of some waves) you will be able
to pull your arms towards your body (your 'pole'). The BDC is driven
by the** breaking of very large planetary waves** (thousands of
kilometres long)

Gerber uses a** fairly simple atmospheric model** to look at the
behaviour of the BDC. The model isn't meant to be like the real
world. Instead it's meant to simulate the fluid dynamics of the
atmosphere in a way which looks something like the real world. It
follows the same physical laws as the real world. This means the
physics we learn about using the model can be applied to the real
world.

This paper picks out two ways in which the BDC can change.
	
  1. **Tropospheric control**. Increase the wave activity and the BDC
     will become stronger.
	
  2. **Stratospheric control**. Increase the strength of the polar
     vortex (westerly winds in the winter hemisphere of the
     stratosphere) and the upward movement of waves will change.

The effects of the control mechanisms on the BDC can be easily seen by
looking at the '**age**' of the air. This is the time since the air
was at a given level in the atmosphere (in this paper, 100 hPa, or
around 20 km). The picture below shows the age for different model
setups. Red colours show older air, indicating a slower circulation.

Tropospheric control is the easier one to understand. If the BDC is
driven by waves, increasing the wave activity will make it
stronger. What does 'increasing the wave activity' mean? Well, the
amplitude ('size') of the waves can be increased by changing the
height of the mountains producing them. This is the what the study
does. It sounds silly, because for the foreseeable future the
mountains on this planet are going to stay much the same. But this is
just the simple approach Gerber took in the paper. In fact, the
**amplitude of the planetary waves can be changed** by large-scale
changes in the air pressure in the lower atmosphere (such as the
'Arctic Oscillation', which is an expression of the latitude of the
jet stream).

The stratospheric control mechanism is a little more subtle than the
tropospheric one. Changing the winds in the stratospheric polar vortex
changes the way waves behave. If the vortex is very weak, waves are
trapped at the base of the stratosphere (under 20 km). This means the
_bottom part_ of the BDC speeds up, but the _top part slows down_. If
the vortex is strong, waves can move all the way up into the
stratosphere, so the _top part speeds up_.

Gerber's experiments agree with some previous work indicating the BDC
has **two branches**: an upper and a lower (you can see this in the
first picture: the lower part is around 20 km while the upper part
goes up to around 50 km). They seem to affected in different ways. The
lower branch is most susceptible to changes in the waves coming from
below; the upper branch is modified by changes in the way waves behave
once they are in the stratosphere.

Why is this important? The BDC **transports ozone** to the poles, and
ozone is important for protecting living things from harmful
ultra-violet sunlight. Changes in the upward motion at the bottom of
the stratosphere also change the level of the tropopause (thick blue
line in the first picture). This is important because the level of the
tropopause governs how much water vapour gets into the
stratosphere. In the troposphere, extra water just rains out, but in
the stratosphere extra water vapour exerts a warming influence on the
Earth's surface. If the tropopause gets lower it moves to a warmer
region of the atmosphere, which allows more water vapour to get into
the stratosphere. So it's important we understand how and why the BDC
does what it does.

It is unusual to find a single-author paper of such detail
nowadays. It is also unusual to find such a readable paper on a highly
technical subject. As I have said I find stratospheric dynamics quite
tricky, but this paper really nicely illustrated the important
physical principles without giving me a headache. There is a lot more
in the paper than in this summary, but I hope it has at least given
you a flavour of the clear, focused experimental design and the
excellent presentation of its arguments.
