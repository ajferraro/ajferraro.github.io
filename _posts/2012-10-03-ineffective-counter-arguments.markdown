Watching
BBC3's _[Free Speech](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01dbmwh) _programme
tonight, I noticed an excellent example of a hollow debate in which
two sides argue two completely different issues. Their positions
reflect their cultural biases. The discussion was about a campaign
asking the editor of the Sun newspaper to stop printing pictures of
topless women (the infamous 'Page 3'). The two sides can be (very
roughly) summarised thus:



>  **Position 1**: The Sun is a mainstream newspaper and printing
> photographs of topless women perpetuates a culture in which women
> are measured against their physical attributes. Looking good naked
> is inconsequential and women should be valued for their intellectual
> achievements.

>  **Position 2**: Women are free to make money selling photographs of
> themselves in whatever state of undress they like. If some people do
> not like this, they can express their disapproval by simply not
> buying the newspaper.




These two positions are clearly in opposition, but one is not a
counter-argument to the other. In the programme these two viewpoints
were expressed repeatedly and yet no one directly addressed either
argument.





### Nothing is ever debated




Position 1 argues that the _cultural message_ of printing these
pictures in a mainstream newspaper is not one we want to
encourage. It _does not _argue that erotic photographs are wrong, or
women who pose for these photographs are exploited victims. To rebut
this argument one must argue against the contention that these images
foster gender-discriminatory attitudes that have no place in our
society.




Position 2 takes a classic 'freedom' stance: women should be free to
do what they like, as should the newspaper-buying public. To rebut
this argument one must either rebut the case for this type of freedom
(quite a difficult task) or rebut the contention that Page 3 is a
problem because people take offence (easier). Position 1 nearly does
it. It points out that Page 3 can be damaging to people who never even
pick up a copy of the Sun, because it perpetuates attitudes towards
women which contribute to continued gender inequality (highly visible
in the gender pay gap).




By my analysis, one can rebut Position 2 by identifying the values
behind the argument. Those who subscribe to Position 2 are likely to
think their opponents are against personal freedom, whereas it is
clear from Position 1 that that is not what their opponents are
arguing. Those arguing from Position 1 should Position 2 and explain
that, though nothing in the argument is incorrect, there are other
reasons why we should campaign to stop the printing of images of nude
women in a mainstream newspaper.





### Climate science debates are climate policy debates in disguise




This may seem tangential to the main theme of this blog, but I see
parallels here with 'debates' on climate change and climate
policy. Many who argue irrationally against the basic physical science
of climate change do so because of their cultural biases against
climate policies. Those who value industry, consumer goods and wealth
are unlikely to accept necessarily anti-consumptive policies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. _People take positions on one topic but in
fact argue from deeply entrenched but irrelevant positions on
another_. In order to understand arguments one must understand the
underlying cultural biases.

Understanding cultural bias both helps people to construct stronger
arguments and helps people to rebut them. In other words, it makes
debate more robust, and (hopefully) helps us converge on an
appropriate course of action. And yet people seem completely unaware
of the values systems underlying different arguments on climate,
include their own. Dan Kahan makes this point eloquently in his
[paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1981907) as
part of the
[Cultural Cognition Project](http://www.culturalcognition.net/).
