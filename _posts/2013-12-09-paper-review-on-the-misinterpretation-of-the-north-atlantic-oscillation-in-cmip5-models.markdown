The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a big hitter in the world of
atmospheric dynamics. It’s everywhere, and it (or its close relations
the Arctic Oscillation and Northern Annular Mode) invoked in pretty
much every explanation of why midlatitude countries get the weather
they do. But what is it?

In the simplest terms, the North Atlantic Oscillation is an expression
of the location of the jet stream, a band of strong winds which
circles the globe at a latitude of about 45 degrees. Weather systems
form on the jet stream and are steered along with it. The jet stream
wobbles north and south (like most fluids, it forms eddies), and
depending on its latitude it might send a storm into the Mediterranean
or to the United Kingdom.

The NAO is often used as a neat way to summarise the behaviour of the
jet stream. In the real atmosphere it describes a specific pattern of
variation in its position, but as this paper (and others) shows, this
pattern isn't exactly the same in climate models.

An aside before we begin. It’s not really correct to say the NAO
explains why the jet stream and weather systems are where they
are. The NAO must be a certain way if the jet stream is where it
is. It’s just a description, like saying, ‘we got a storm because we
are at the latitude where the storm was’. The reasons for the way the
jet shifts north and south are complex and really not obvious, and
we’re learning more about it all the time.

So that’s what the NAO is in general terms. When we analyse
atmospheric data we give it a mathematical form. This involves a
tricky but really rather clever analysis technical called Empirical
Orthogonal Function analysis (or Principal Components analysis). I
won’t go into it here but it’s basically a way to pull out a pattern
according to which something varies. If you think of the pattern of
variation of a swinging pendulum, it’s main variation pattern is a
back and forth swing. For the jet stream, the main variation is a
north and south wobble - the NAO.

The convention is, when the NAO is in a negative phase the jet is
shifted southward, and when it is in a positive phase it is shifted
northward. Generally, it's also wavier in its negative phase than its
positive phase, and more waviness means more 'blocking', which is when
we get big meanders, producing high pressure systems which hang around
for a week or so and give stable, calm weather.

But some climate models don’t have an NAO that behaves like this. For
some of them, the main variability includes too much northward
wobbling and not enough southward wobbling. Another group has
variability which is more like a pulsing of the speed, going from fast
to slow and back again, without any wobbling. For some the north-south
wobbling is simply too weak.

This paper shows the weakness of the mathematical definition of the
NAO - it’s not the same between different models! The examples above
represent different physical processes so it’s meaningless to lump
them together like this. But, importantly, all the models do have
something like the real-world NAO - that is, the north-south
wobbling. It’s just that the standard mathematical definition doesn’t
always pick that out. This is the peril of using a mathematical
construction with no physical basis to define variations in the jet
latitude which are the result of specific physical processes.

Obviously it’s better to think of things, if we can, in terms of the
physical processes involved rather than this rather obscure
mathematical idea. Davini and Cagnazzo end their paper with this
recommendation:
