In a previous
[post](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/thesis-writing-outlining/)
I wrote a bit about outlining: a useful and pretty basic technique for
planning any body of writing. You set down what you want to write, in
order. Then you write it.  It is quite rare to be able to structure
the argument beforehand in this way. I use an outline for a very
high-level overview of my thesis. It is essentially a table of
contents. I find outlining too restrictive for planning the content of
a section. I switch to a close relative: the concept map.




I doubt I would be alone in being initially disparaging of the 'mind
maps' we are encouraged to create by enthusiastic teachers. I didn't
get the point. Back then I understood what I was writing with
sufficient clarity to be able to hold things in my head. I did not
need a map around my mind.




Things have got rather more complicated since then. I can't hold a
whole thesis section in my mind. The material is too detailed and
subtle for that. Sure, I understand the concepts, and what material I
want to include, and I might even understand how the concepts
interact. This does not mean I understand intuitively how to write
these things down in a coherent fashion appropriate for my thesis. So
I revisited the 'mind map', which I prefer to call a 'concept
map'. They are surprisingly effective provided you actually need to
use them to structure subtle arguments.




The image at the top of the post shows a concept map I drew for a
relatively straightforward section of my thesis. I divided it into
three clear topics. There isn't much interaction between the
topics. Then I scribbled down a load of things I want to cover. I'm
not quite sure of the order of things yet, but by writing things down
I can visualise how things fit together. I have included a few key
references but it is safe to say I have not fully worked out how this
section is going to work. The concept map is a freeze-frame of the
state of development. I can add to it later.




The image below shows a very different concept map. It is for the
'ethical and social' section of my thesis, which is a brief section
explaining some of the non-scientific issues around
geoengineering. The subject matter is profoundly different from every
other section and not something I am too familiar with. I recently
attended a transdisciplinary summer school hosted by the
[Oxford Geoengineering Programme](http://www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk/),
and that gave me enough information to write down what I thought were
the key concepts. Then I did a little reading around each to make sure
I understood them properly, and added references in red. Finally I
attempted to link some concepts together (arrows). There are four
groups on the map below, though the one on the bottom and right is
quite a loose grouping.

Seeing all the things I needed to cover in this format allowed me to
quickly test out different combinations in my head. Which concepts
were related? What are the broad topic areas involved? What is the
relevance of all this to my discipline, atmospheric science? The
concept map is not just a planning tool; it is a thinking one. I
should have taken snapshots as I built it up, because it would have
revealed much of my thought process.




I suppose 'mind map' is not a bad phrase. These things do indeed act
as guides, allowing you to forget banal things like remembering all
the things you're supposed to be thinking about and focusing on the
significance of these things to each other and your thesis. I referred
to the map constantly while I was writing this section of my thesis
and I found it a pleasure to write, having got a lot of the
nitty-gritty part out of the way. Having it set out in front of me
freed my brain for the more exciting mental gymnastics of arguing
persuasively and coherently and writing clearly.
