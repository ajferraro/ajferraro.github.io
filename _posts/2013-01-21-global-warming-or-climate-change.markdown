Sometimes the terms 'global warming' and 'climate change' are used
interchangeably in everyday conversation. I don't think there is too
much of a difference if one is talking generally about the
human-caused increase in global average temperature and its associated
impacts. Nevertheless, they do
[describe different things](http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/climate_by_any_other_name.html).


**Global warming**_. _It's a warming that has to be
  global. Obviously. It doesn't have to be a year-on-year increase in
  temperature. We have no more reason to expect every year to be
  hotter than the last than we do to expect every month, or every day
  to be hotter than the last. There are other causes of variation in
  temperature. The rising and setting of the sun, the changing of the
  seasons, the switching of the tropical Pacific from a heat-absorbing
  La Nina to a heat-giving El Nino, and so on. But the central point
  here is that it strictly describes just the _temperature _of the
  Earth.

**Climate change**. This is a little harder to
  define. '[Climate](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/storms-are-like-cake-analogies-for-weather-and-climate/)'
  is the average conditions in the atmosphere ('what we expect'). It
  is not limited to temperature. Sure, temperature is important, but
  so is rainfall. So is the wind. 'Climate change' encompasses all
  these. The climate is never entirely stationary. It can change
  subtly over time or it can undergo wild swings such as those the
  Earth saw during its Ice Ages. No climate scientist claims that
  climate change can only be caused by humans.


I think 'global warming' is a better term to use unless one needs to
explicitly include non-temperature effects on climate. Granted, it
does imply (incorrectly) that it includes year-on-year warming. But it
also encapsulates the problem more concisely than 'climate change',
which can feel like a vague buzzword. As I have explained, it's not
vague, it just includes things other than temperature effects. It's
useful because some of the most significant impacts of increasing
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels might not be temperature
effects. They might be related to droughts, storms, sea-level rise,
ocean acidification, and so on.

The term 'climate change' certainly has its place if you genuinely
need to go beyond temperature and include all the impacts of
increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. If you are talking specifically
about sea-level rise, talk about 'sea-level rise associated with
global warming', not generically about 'climate change'. That's
because the single best way to get people to understand what you're
talking about is to, you know, tell them what you're talking about.

EDIT: NASA
[disagrees](http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/climate_by_any_other_name.html)
with my preference.
