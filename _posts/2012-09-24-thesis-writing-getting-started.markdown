It is very important to make your thesis _look __readable. _The
quality of your writing determines how readable it actually is, but if
your text is presented in a sloppy fashion you may lose your reader
early on and struggle to engage them again. Your material is going to
be technical and quite tricky to follow. It is your job to make the
communication of your work as painless to the reader as possible.





#### LaTeX - nerdy at first, seamless after a while




I use [LaTeX](http://www.tug.org/begin.html) to typeset my
thesis. There is a lot already written about LaTeX on web, so I won't
bother with that. The main difference is that you use 'tags' or
'markup' to create formatting. LaTeX documents are plain text files
which contain instructions for the LaTeX program. You then tell the
LaTeX program to convert those instructions into the finished
document. Formatting is no longer your direct responsibility. Want a
heading? Just write \section{Title}. LaTeX will format it
accordingly. It takes a while to get your head around. I learned it
over a few days while I was on placement at the Met Office in 2009,
and have barely used a wordprocessor since. I use LaTeX for
typesetting proper documents and plain text for everything else.




The main advantage of LaTeX is that images don't madly jump around the
page like they do in wordprocessors, and there is a facility, called
BibTeX, which makes referencing and creating bibliographies a
breeze. Seriously. It is so much better than anything else out
there. I use [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) to generate my
reference list which slots straight into my LaTeX files. It's
beautiful. There are also plenty of LaTeX thesis templates out
there. Here in the Department of Meteorology PhD students 'inherit'
thesis templates and make their own modifications. There are a few
floating around, each with their own distinct lineage. The one I use
has a very elegant structure, with files for each chapter kept
separately. It's quite nerdy, and actually typestting it involves
running a custom-written program which does all sorts of complicated
stuff, but the outcome is pleasant.





#### The blank page




Now onto the more difficult point: how to actually get started
writing. There has been so much written about the terror of the blank
page that I feel this might be a little superfluous. Nevertheless I
might be able to offer a few comments.




When I get the 'blank page fear', it is because I have not planned
what I am going to say. Work that out first. What's your goal? If you
don't have one, don't write anything just yet. You will have no idea
what to write until you have an idea of what to say. When you are
talking to people about complicated things your speech will become
more measured. In informal conversation words just come to you, but
when it gets important, words have to be carefully selected. The same
thing has to happen with your writing. Work out what you need to
communicate first. Draw arrows around your
[concept map](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/thesis-writing-concept-maps/)
so you have a sense of what you're going to write about first and how
that leads to the next thing.




When you do start, you will feel tentative. It is the same feeling as
when there is a long silence in a conversation and the silence becomes
quite tangible. You will be reluctant to break that silence and your
first words will be halting. You will tempted to write something like
'One of the most important things...' or 'There are many factors
contributing to...'. This is dull. If you are telling me this in your
first sentence I already know it is going to be an important
factor. So by all means start like this to get things flowing, but you
may want to go back and revise it to something more vigorous.





#### Vigorous openings - an example




<blockquote>One argument for geoengineering research (though not
necessarily deployment) is that there may come a time when deployment
will be preferable to any other option. If mitigation efforts continue
to fail and the threat of climate change is severe, the risks
associated with SRM deployment may become preferable to the risks of
unmitigated climate change.</blockquote>




Today I improved this opening couple of sentences by making the first
bit a lot stronger.





<blockquote>Geoengineering research is justifiable only if a situation
can be conceived of when deployment is a desirable option. The 'arm
the future' argument for research (though not necessarily deployment)
is that is would be prudent to investigate the full range of possible
policy response to climate change, in case there comes a time when
deployment is preferable to other options.</blockquote>




Weak, tentative prose comes from a mind lacking confidence. Practice
by looking at examples of your writing and thinking about ways to make
it more direct and assertive. Then apply it. I will write more about
vigorous prose in a later post, but for now let me say that Strunk &
White's _[The Elements of Style](http://www.bartleby.com/141/)_ is
most useful. It is a concise collection of examples of how to make
written English more readable. The precise rules aren't important. The
overall effect, driven by the examples of good and bad English, is
vital.
