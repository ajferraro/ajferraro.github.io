_EDIT: Results
[here](http://angusferraro.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/the-working-day-of-a-phd-student/)._

I have been meaning to write a post about work-life balance since I
started this blog. I hear many PhD students say they feel stressed
because they can't switch off. They are constantly 'working', because
they are not contracted to work a certain number of hours like proper
members of staff. This constant worrying about work is unlikely to
make you more productive. The solution is to realise that you have
done enough work.

Alternatively, you could cultivate such warmth towards your work that
it no longer stresses you. I enjoy my work so much that even when I
work late into the evening I don't tend to feel stressed. Tired,
yes. Frustrated, of course, because its usually a troublesome piece of
computer code that's keeping me there. But I try to divorce that
temporary frustration from my contentment that I have a life in which
_I get paid to learn_. Could anything be better?

It is very hard to constantly have warm feelings towards your PhD
project. Sometimes you will hate it. You will feel like you are not
progressing and that you never will. This is normal, and this is why
PhDs take years to complete. I think it's valuable training to learn
to deal with that frustration, to notice it, but to let it pass you
by. Sometimes, when you are feeling fed up with it all, it's best to
stop. Continuing in this frame of mind will only accomplish two
things: you will make little progress because of your stress and
frustration, or you will produce sub-standard work because you are
tired and just want to get it done. Best to take a break. Sometimes
you can come back to it that day. Sometimes you'll need to sleep on
it.

It's OK to stop. You have time.

It's all very well saying that there's plenty of time, but as a
scientist I thought I should find out _how much time_. How many hours
does a successful PhD student put in and what do they do during those
hours?

I thought I would do a little experiment on myself. I am, perhaps
hubristically, defining myself as a 'successful PhD student'. I don't
mean that I'm outstanding. I just mean that my project is going OK and
I plan to submit within three and a half years and I anticipate being
able to call myself 'Doctor' not too long after that. I am going to
record the number of hours per day that I spend at work and what I do
during those hours.

I am recording time in half-hour chunks, which I think is a reasonable
time resolution. I decided one-hour chunks were too limiting, because
quite often I change what I am doing during the course of an
hour. Plus, my procrastination rarely eats up a whole hour, but it
does quite regularly devour 30 minutes at once. After a couple of days
trialling, I have settled on a number of 'activity tags' to define
what I am doing. They are:

  * **understanding** - active research, including reading, to find
    out specific things
	
  * **reading** - reading papers and other articles without a
    clearly-defined purpose

  * **writing** - thesis or other smaller piece of writing; blog
    posts; note-making
	
  * **coding **- making plots or setting up models
	
  * **meeting** - formal supervisor meetings, generally chatting to
    other scientists about work, going to seminars
	
  * **nowork **- procrastination, or taking a break

The data will go into a
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At2X4JkfK94EdFI2cWd6bnpDOGZhcHVkLXhlQjFFYWc)
which tots up the number of hours I'm spending on different things. As
you can see the timeline only goes to 7pm. I never work later than
that. I plan to record my activities for the whole of January, which
should be a long enough period to capture some interesting features
(including transition from holiday to work period to undergraduate
term-time). The results should be out in February.
