>If we cut down all the trees, how long would it take us to die?  What
qualities do you need to become a great scientist?  When is the zombie
apocalypse going to happen?

These are some of the questions I have been pondering over the past
two weeks as part of the online event
‘[I’m a scientist, get me out of here](http://imascientist.org.uk/)’. The
event puts scientists (grouped into themed ‘zones’) in touch with
groups of school children around the country. Children can send
questions to the scientists at any time, but what’s even better is
they can interact with them in scheduled live chats.

Children vote for their favourite scientist, and at the end of the two
weeks one in each zone gets £500 to spend on a science engagement
project of their choice.

‘I’m a scientist’ is structured as a competition, but I don’t really
think that’s the point. I signed up because I thought it would be
fun. I signed up because I can imagine getting a lot out of the event
as a schoolchild (which wasn’t particularly long ago - I finished
secondary school in 2007). When I was at school I hoovered up facts
and such quite diligently. I didn’t really need to be enthused in
order to learn. Looking back, though, I think I missed the point of it
all.

#### When I was a boy...

To me, school science practicals felt a bit staged. Recording the
resistance of a length of copper wire as it heats up is a useful
experiment: it teaches important principles of electricity and it
demonstrates the scientific method: question, hypothesis, prediction,
test, analyse. But it's not that exciting.

We also spent a long time on a practical about the cooling of
test-tubes of warm water. Which cools slower - a single test tube of
water or a test tube surrounded by others? The one with the others
around it, of course. This experiment was designed to explain why
penguins huddle together and was a perfectly reasonable
demonstration. But it felt a little ‘play-school’ at the time. I had
also been told by my teacher to put a line of best fit through by data
points, but that ‘data points don’t go on the line of best fit’ (thus
I even added measurement error to my fictional observations). In fact,
I confess, in that experiment I made up some data because I knew what
the relationship should be between the temperature after a certain
time and the number of surrounding test tubes. I was in a hurry and
didn’t want to bother repeating the experiment with more and more
surrounding tubes.

I took away the wrong message from the practical. I was fixated on
matching my results with the information I had already absorbed - that
insulating with additional tubes reduces cooling - rather than
carrying out a correct, valuable experiment. The scientific process
seemed like a rigid set of arbitrary rules back then. I didn’t
appreciate that an experiment done incorrectly is valueless (I should
stress that I do not make up data now, of course).

#### Why was I a rubbish scientist?

But why did I miss the point back then? I think it’s because I
couldn’t quite see the _purpose_ of it all. It was quite obvious to me
that additional test tubes would stop the cooling rate. I just wanted
more information to absorb, not to waste my time confirming what I
already knew. Essentially, I completely misunderstood the point of
learning and the point of science. That is no reflection on my
teachers. It just reflects how children often greatly misunderstand
why they are at school, and consequently don’t get as much out of it
as they should.

#### What's the point then?

Which brings me back, after a very lengthy aside, to why I signed up
to ‘I’m a scientist’. I am now coming to the end of my PhD and I think
I know a little about the scientific method (at least, I know enough
to understand why it’s unacceptable to make up results!). I ‘get’ it
now. I find it thrilling to be doing science when _no one knows the
answer_ and the results are _new and puzzling_. That’s what it’s
about, and that’s what I tried to get across to the kids when
presented with their common question ‘what do you like about
science?’.

I came second in my zone, behind the excellent
[Simon Holyoake](http://earthj13.imascientist.org.uk/profile/simonholyoake/). To
tell the truth, all the scientists in my zone -
[Hannah Bentham](http://earthj13.imascientist.org.uk/profile/hannahbentham/),
[Laura Roberts Artal ](http://earthj13.imascientist.org.uk/profile/laurarobertsartal/)and
[Christian Maerz](http://earthj13.imascientist.org.uk/profile/christianmaerz/) -
were excellent and gave engaging, exciting and thoughtful answers to
the kids’ questions. I think we all had a lot of fun chatting to the
kids, and deciphering some left-field questions. Some of the questions
made me think quite a bit, and explaining things simply really helped
me work out how well I understand some basic scientific principles.

So, to any scientists out there, I highly recommend applying to
participate in the next ‘I’m a scientist events’. To any teachers out
there, I highly recommend getting your class involved. I think events
like this are a very effective way of allowing young people to
understand why they are learning all these equations, why they care
about the difference between igneous and sedimentary rock, why it’s
important to put error bars on graphs, and why they’re in this damn
classroom on a nice sunny day. Because science is important.

There are plenty of questions science cannot answer, and there are
plenty of other valuable forms of knowledge. But science is a great
way of learning useful things about the world, and is pretty special
because of the quality of predictions it makes and the level of
detailed understanding it gives us. That’s why I’m a scientist.
