I came across a fascinating
[news item](http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/news/story.aspx?id=1357&cookieConsent=A)
on Twitter the other day, publicising a paperÂ 
([Ashworth et al. 2013](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate1788.html))
about the effects of certain biofuel crops on air quality. This isn't
my area of expertise at all (assuming I have expertise, that is!) but
I found it an excellent example of the trade-offs humans make in their
interventions in the environment. In densely-populated and
highly-industrialised Europe, where this study is focused, there is no
such thing as 'nature' or the 'natural environment'. Human and natural
systems are intertwined. The study demonstrates how complex this
relationship is.

#### Isoprene emissions from woody biofuels impact human health

In a nutshell, the study showed that replacing crops or grassland with
woody biofuel crops like ash, poplar and willow (which they call
'short rotation coppice') increases concentrations of a chemical
called isoprene in the atmosphere. The vast majority of the isoprene
in the atmosphere comes from plants. Isoprene is quite reactive and
reacts with other chemicals in the atmosphere. If there is a lot of
nitric oxide pollution around, isoprene reacts with it and forms
ozone. Ozone is very important for shielding the Earth's surface from
harmful solar ultra-violet radiation, but it is best kept high in the
atmosphere because it is also harmful to human health.

Nitric oxide and isoprene, therefore, is a bad mixture to have in the
atmosphere. The resulting ozone is linked to asthma, bronchitis and
heart attacks. Planting 72 million hectares of biofuel crops across
Europe, the study estimated the isoprene-related ozone could cause
between 690 and 1,890 additional deaths each year. Ozone is also
harmful to crop growth, and they estimated crop losses with a value of
$1-2bn (in 2010 dollars).

#### Other effects of isoprene

Isoprene is also implicated in the formation of secondary organic
aerosol. These are tiny particles ('aerosols') which both absorb and
reflect solar radiation. Most aerosols (except very sooty ones) tend
to be more reflective, which means they cool the surface. A cloud of
aerosols works much like a cloud of water droplets in this sense,
providing a sunshade. These aerosols are 'organic' because they come
from compounds produced by plants, and 'secondary' because these
compounds first have to undergo some chemical reactions in the
atmosphere before the aerosols are produced.

Secondary organic aerosols are still quite poorly understood and offer
plenty of interesting research opportunities. We don't even understand
whether isoprene always increases the amount of secondary organic
aerosol or whether it sometimes decreases it.

#### Choose your biofuel crops carefully

In my research for this post I came across another paper
([Crespo et al. 2013](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231012009636))
which looked at emissions of isoprene (and other so-called 'volatile
organic compounds') from different types of biofuel crops. They showed
that the problem of isoprene emissions is much bigger for woody crops,
such as the ones used in the Ashworth study I mentioned earlier. Most
plants emit isoprene but some do so much more than others.

<blockquote>[O]ur data suggest that the use of perennial grasses for
extensive growing for biofuel production have lower emissions than
woody species, which might be important for regional atmospheric
chemistry.</blockquote>

The 'perennial grasses' they study are things like 'elephant grass', a
fast-growing crop which is already being grown in the UK.

I find the interplay between the 'natural' and the 'human' especially
interesting here. Humans may think they are doing something natural
(or at least modifying the environment is a sympathetic way) by
planting these crops. The 'natural' isoprene emissions combine with
human pollution (nitric oxide) and produce ozone pollution, which
affects human health, crop yields and 'natural' plant growth.
