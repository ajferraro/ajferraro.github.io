On 15 October The Guardian released a
[news story](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering?CMP=twt_gu)
about an ocean fertilisation experiment, uncovered by the
[ETC Group](http://www.etcgroup.org/), which took place this July. It
reported that around 100 tonnes of iron sulphate was dumped into the
Pacific off the west coast of Canada. This is an 'ocean fertilisation'
approach to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) geoengineering.




The idea is that adding nutrients to the ocean encourages algae to
form. The algae take in carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, then sink to
the ocean floor and 'lock up' the CO2 for the foreseeable future. It
is very much a speculative idea. There are legitimate concerns about
the ecological impact of ocean fertilisation, as well as serious
questions about the amount of CO2 that can be removed from the
atmosphere in this fashion.




The UN
[London Protocol](http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Environment/SpecialProgrammesAndInitiatives/Pages/London-Convention-and-Protocol.aspx)
regulates dumping of potentially hazardous material into the oceans,
and the [Convention on Biological Diversity](http://www.cbd.int/)
prohibits large-scale geoengineering experiments if there is a risk to
biodiversity. Whether this experiment is in violation of these two
legal instruments is a question for the lawyers.




Even if there is no legal case against this experiment, there is
plenty to raise concern. This was a significant geoengineering
experiment by a private individual, Russ George, presumably motivated
by the potential profits from selling the carbon credits from
CDR. Even if ocean fertilisation does work, without proper regulation
carbon pricing effectively incentivises environmental modification to
sequester CO2 regardless of the ecological impacts. What's more, it
appears George persuaded the local indigenous people to contribute
financially to the tune of $1m.





<blockquote>The village people voted to support what they were told
was a 'salmon enhancement project' and would not have agreed if they
had been told of any potential negative effects or that it was in
breach of an international convention

- Guujaaw, President of the Haida nation</blockquote>




George is quoted in the Guardian article dismissing criticism, saying
the UN regulations do not apply to this case and claiming his
experiment was the 'most substantial ocean restoration project in
history.'




It looks very bad when exploratory research and experimentation on a
new, potentially damaging technology is carried out by a controversial
private individual with a clear personal profit motive. It looks even
worse when the same individual misleads local stakeholders into partly
funding such experiments. I hope we can get some clarification on the
aims, extent and legality of this project in the near future. The only
information source is the Guardian and a smattering of echo-chamber
rehashings of the Guardian story elsewhere on the web.




COP11 of the CBD is currently in session in Hyderabad. It is due to
finish on 19 October. Will they make a statement on this experiment?




UPDATE (17/10/12): As ever, the public
[geoengineering discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/geoengineering/UHBYBcurPn4)
is a good source of information. The legality of the experiment is
discussed. It is also pointed out that clear information about the
incident is very limited which makes it hard to draw conclusions.
