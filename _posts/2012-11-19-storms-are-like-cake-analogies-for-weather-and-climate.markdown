_(cake analogy at the bottom)_

#### Weather & climate

Illustrative analogies for the difference between weather and climate
are quite common nowadays. The simplest description of the difference
is that weather is the conditions produced by the atmosphere, and
climate is the statistics of weather. 'Statistics' could be simple
averages, or some much more sophisticated techniques.

The
[World Meteorological Organisation](http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/faqs.html#q1)
says that 'climate' statistics must be calculated over a period of 30
years or longer, but this is merely a convention. The period depends
on the physical phenomenon we are thinking about. The goal of climate
statistics is to essentially get rid of the random variation of
weather, so the period we choose depends on how much random variation
we need to get rid of. For example, I don't need to watch the Sun rise
too many times before I decide that the Sun is probably going to be
doing that for the foreseeable future. There is no variation, so I
don't need to watch it for very long.

#### Using climate to make predictions

Let's say we want to work out what the maximum temperature on July
14th 2013 here in Reading, UK. The average maximum temperature in
Reading in July is 22 C, so I'll stick my neck out and say that the
maximum temperature on July 14th 2013 in Reading is going to be 22
C. A number of things could go wrong here. We might get a weather
system coming through which brings down cold air from the north or
warm air from the south and this would ruin my prediction. We don't
know what the weather will be doing, but at least we can say that July
is likely to be about 22 C. It's certainly more useful estimating
based on past experience than just guessing. For example, I would be
willing to bet the maximum temperature isn't going to be 5 C.

This method only works if we work out the average temperature over a
long enough period. If I just take the average of, say, July 2011 and
July 2010, I wouldn't have much confidence in the number I get. That's
because all it takes is a few weather systems changing where the wind
comes from to knock the temperature away from what is expected. If we
take 30 Julys, though, most of these random variations will average
out. The cold Julys will cancel out the warm Julys and we'll end up
with a good expression of the usual temperature.

So climate statistics give us some power in prediction. But we are
assuming climate stays the same. Usually, July temperatures in Reading
hit a maximum of 22 C. Climate change means that usual temperature
changes. If the Earth warms up it doesn't mean it will never be as
cold as 22 C in Reading in July again. We still might get cold spells
of weather when the wind blows down from the Arctic. It just means
that it will beÂ _more usual than before_ to see a higher maximum
temperature.

#### Analogies for weather & climate

Many analogies are used to express the difference between the weather
experienced right now and climate. There are two I especially like:

  * A man walking a dog. The man will follow a path and walks with
    purpose. He knows the route. The dog will dash about, distracted
    by other animals or curious smells, either side of the path. He
    can't go to far from the man because he is being held with a
    lead. The dog is the weather, and the man is climate. This is the
    analogy presented in the video at the top of this post.
    
  * Sea level and waves. Consider a boat moored at a harbour. Climate
    is the level the boat is at. Every now and then a swell comes in
    and lifts the boat a bit. But it will soon go down again. Most
    people wouldn't say the boat is getting higher just because the
    waves lift it. But if the tide comes in (climate change), the boat
    will be lifted and keep on going up. But the pattern of swells
    means there might be times when the boat is going down.

#### Cake time

Some have asked whether climate change 'caused' October's Superstorm
Sandy and the damage it did to the north-east USA. The
[reality](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/the-whole-truth-about-superstorm-sandy-and-climate-change/2012/11/15/d3b7ceea-29e4-11e2-bab2-eda299503684_blog.html)
is far more subtle. Climate change does not 'cause' weather
events. The atmosphere causes weather events to happen. Climate change
alters the atmosphere, so it stands to reason that it will affect
weather, but it won't cause it. My analogy for this involves cake
(because everyone likes cake!).

The atmosphere is the only cause of weather. But the atmosphere is
changing.
