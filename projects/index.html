    <p><a href="geoengineering">Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering.</a>
    This was the subject of my PhD work but I have kept thinking about
    geoengineering since.</p>

    <p><a href="stratclim">Stratosphere and climate change.</a>
    The stratosphere, once thought to be a quiescent layer stuck on
    top of the troposphere, has been shown to influence climate
    lower down through dynamical and radiative effects. I am interested
    in how we can use our knowledge of the stratosphere to understand
    what we might expect under human-driven global warming.</p>

    <p><a href="wvfb">Water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks.</a>
    The water vapour feedback is the largest positive feedback
    in the climate system. I am interested in how confident we are
    of our theories about it, and also in its regional pattern as a
    diagnostic of physical processes and a driver of regional climate
    change.</p>
