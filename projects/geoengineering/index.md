description="Three climate models (CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-LR)
did simulations of the future with and without geoengineering. The
simulations with stratospheric aerosols (G3 and G4) show greater
temperature-independent precipitation reductions than the simulations
without them (RCP4.5 and G3S)." %}
